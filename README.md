There is an ipynb file that contains code for training the VGG16 model with a dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images

Deep_fake_Detector folder and its zipped files is a folder that can be run using streamlit with the command ‘streamlit run main.py’. The model ‘best_model.tflite’ can be downloaded at https://huggingface.co/MichaelIvanS/VGG16-Deepfake/resolve/main/best_model.tflite and then put into the 'assets' folder before running streamlit
